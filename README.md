# Exercise_0
## Goal
Develop your own simple Feed-Forward Neural Network in Python (CNN).
## Rquirements 
* Implement the basic layers for multi-layer percepterons and CNN
* Try to include the most common operations between layers such as convolution and max-pooling
* The code should be easy to read 
* The implementation should be as modular as possible
## Allowed to
Use core libraries such as Numpy and Scikit-learn
## Nice to have
Optimization on critical operations to improve performance using Cython
## Usage
Use MNIST dataset to provide some usage examples with images
